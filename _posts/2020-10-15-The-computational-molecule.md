title: The Computational Molecule

---

The computatinal molecule; also called stencil, is the key concept to the theory and the implementation of finite difference methods. 
Finite difference methods seek to find numerical solutions to partial diffferential equations. The computational molecule is a geometric arrangement of a nodal group that relate to the point of interest.  For example if we want to calculate the temperature in the middel (green points) of a slab knowing the temperature of the slab on the sides (red points).
