In this post I will explain and summarize [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063520306000546) awesome paper.  The idea behind diffusion maps is dimensionality reduction.  Some datasets (i.e. images) contains useful geometric shapes, and these shapes  diffusion maps is an efficient representations of these shapes.
