In this post I will explain and summarize [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063520306000546) awesome paper.  The idea behind diffusion maps is dimensionality reduction.  Some datasets (i.e. images) contains useful geometric shapes, and these images often have too many factors (features) and most of the time these features are redundant. Diffusion maps is an efficient representations of these features because it provides a framework where these features are reduced into a smaller number, hence dimensionality reduction.
