The need for riemannian geometry arises from the fact that there does not always exist a system of coordinates in 
terms of which the distance between any two neighboring points in the space is given by the sum of the squares of the 
coordinate differentials.  The first example comes to mind is a particle moving on the surface of a sphere. 

This mathematical framework is useful for finding meaningful geometric descriptions in data sets. 
If we let $q^m$ where $m=1 ... f$ be a set of coordinates which define a point in configuration space and another set of coordinates ${q \bar}^n$ where $n=1 ... f$ which are functions of $q^m$:

$${q \bar}^n = {q\bar}^n(q^1 ... q^f)$$

Infinitesimal changes $dq^m$ in the $q^m$ define infinitesimal changes $dq \bar^n$ in the $q \bar^n$ by 
$$dq\bar^n = \partial{q\bar^2}$$
