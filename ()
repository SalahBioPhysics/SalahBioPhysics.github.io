This is Anagha, and this is my attempt to explain what are Markov Chains. 
This is where I'm going to explain it. 

A Markov Chain is a model that outlines the statistical probability of a random process. They are mathematical systems that use a previous state to determine the probability distribution of the current state. 
Markov chains are made of two things: 
* A State Space 
* A Probability Transition Function
